# TODO:
#       work on separating and encorporating the responsibilities of the UI and Game classes
#           - which one exactly does what?
#           - if UI is responsible for displaying and intake all of the information,
#             how do I integrate the Game class methods into it?
#           - do I call the UI methods from within the Game class to run the game?
#           - Game should probably create an instance of the UI class rather than the other way around
#           - that means modifying the current setup of the UI initializer
#           - that also means that Game class won't get player in the __init__ but at some point later
#       Make sure all take_turn functions return a number between 1 and 9 (same
#                as the initial available positions)
#       Add type hints to functions
#       UI class has get_game_object method which might be unnecessary, and 
#                Game object should instantiate a UI class
