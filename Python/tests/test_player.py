# TODO: Make a function that will convert a string representation of a board
# like shown below into arrays that can be set as Board object attributes

# Look into parameterizing tests for CPU players with different boards
# Create multiple boards for different games scenarios
# and test each CPU class on those boards (mostly, this is for Hard CPU)
# docs for reference: https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/parametrize.html

# The boards below are intended to be used as tests for Hard_CPU_Player.take_turn()
# They can also be used as test for individual turn sub-functions
# as long as expected returns are adjusted accordingly.

# Generating boards for testing:
# Need at least one board to test each of the Hard_CPU move sub-routines
#
