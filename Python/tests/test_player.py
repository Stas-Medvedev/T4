# Look into parameterizing tests for CPU players with different boards
# Create multiple boards for different games scenarios
# and test each CPU class on those boards (mostly, this is for Hard CPU)
# docs for reference: https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/parametrize.html

# Generating boards for testing:
# Need at least one board to test each of the Hard_CPU move sub-routines
# 
# Sub-routines and boards
# =======================
# 
# Take 5 if available:
# As X       As O
#  | |       X| |
# -+-+-      -+-+-
#  | |        | |
# -+-+-      -+-+-
#  | |        | | 
#
# Can win:
# As X       As O
#  | |X      X|X|
# -+-+-      -+-+-
# O|x|        |X|
# -+-+-      -+-+-
#  |O|       O| |O
# 
# As X       As O
# X| |X      X|O|
# -+-+-      -+-+-
# O|x|       X|X|O
# -+-+-      -+-+-
# O|O|        |X|O
#
# Need to cover:
# As X       As O
#  | |O      O|X|
# -+-+-      -+-+-
# X|O|       X|X|
# -+-+-      -+-+-
#  |X|        |O|
#
# Check diagonal case:
# As O       As O
# X| |        | |X
# -+-+-      -+-+-
#  |O|        |O|
